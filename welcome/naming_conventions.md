# File Naming

## Smart Contracts

### Source

 * We use solidity
 * File name are always CamelCase
 * Each file has only one smart contract

### Tests

 * We use TypeScript
 * Files have **.test.ts** extension
 * File name is always CamelCase procced by a number that determines the order (eg. `01_SomeContract.test.ts`)
 * Each file tests only one contract or a portion of it

The branches have the following format:
branch_type/feature-hints

Where `branch_type` must be one of new/bug/refactor.
 * New: We are adding functionality that didn't exist before.
 * Bug: We are fixing something that is broken.
 * Refactor: The functionality is not changing, but we are making the code better.

Where `feature` is one word referring to the target feature for this branch.

And where `hints` is one word, sometimes none, sometimes two, referring to the change.

Examples:
`new/whitelist`
`new/issuance-tokens`
`refactor/readme-contribute`
`bug/ci-yarn-integrity`

# File Naming

## Smart Contracts

### Source

 * We use solidity
 * File name are always CamelCase
 * Each file has only one smart contract

### Tests

 * We use TypeScript
 * Files have **.test.ts** extension
 * File name is always CamelCase procced by a number that determines the order (eg. `01_SomeContract.test.ts`)
 * Each file tests only one contract or a portion of it

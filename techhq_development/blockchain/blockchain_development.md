# Solidity Development (Ethereum Based)

The [cryptozombies.io](cryptozombies.io) tutorial is pretty fun to learn solidity with, it will give you a better idea of actual use cases for blockchain.

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) - The easiest solidity IDE to start with.
http://remix.ethereum.org

Learn to run a [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) node locally

[Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache) is a locally running Ethereum blockchain which is a much faster option for testing and debugging that connecting to a public blockchain.

[Visual Studio Code](techhq_development/development_environments.md) is a development IDE with good support for solidity.

Implement the **crowdsale** example from the Ethereum.org website in Remix

Work through the [ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) tutorials to improve the security of your contracts.

Implement an ERC20 token and deploy it to a testnet (ropsten)

Check OpenZeppelin for libraries (and maybe tutorials) [here](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/guides/)

Like it or not, every time that it is possible to avoid writing in Solidity, people have done so. JavaScript can be used for front-ends and contract testing. Likewise, any computation that can be moved from the blockchain to the front-end should be moved, to minimize costs.

# Stellar

> Stellar is a platform that connects banks, payments systems, and people. Integrate to move money quickly, reliably, and at almost no cost.

Stellar allows to create non-turing complete contracts. This mean that, there don't allow the developer to do everything, but they are still very versatile.

Accounts are managed using a public keys and a private key. An account to be valid needs to have at least 1 XLM \(lumen\).

Stellar have a public mainnet and a public testnet which is reset from time to time. It also as a transactions explorer, named Stellar Laboratory \([https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/](https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/)\) which allows any user to view transactions, balances, and more.

There is no programming language for contract or user permisions like in Ethereum or Hyperledger respectively. In stellar, the contracts are done using SDK's for some already existing programming languages, like Javascript, Go, Python, Ruby and more.

As shown in the image above \(and explained here [https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/index.html](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/get-started/index.html) more in-depth\) stellar uses 2 layers. The stellar core, which is a group of machines that create the network, and then, the HOrizon server to do the connection between the stellar core and the wallets/apps.

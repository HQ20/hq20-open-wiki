# @hq20/contracts release process.

We will have monthly releases. For each release we will create a milestone in github: https://github.com/HQ20/contracts.

The releases will happen on the first monday of every month (except January which will be the second).

The milestones will be created empty. Anyone can pick up an issue and work on it.

On the third monday of every month we will have a call to discuss candidates for the next release.

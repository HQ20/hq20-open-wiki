# Gas Less

On public mainnet, every transaction has a fee. Not all users have ETH to pay that fee, and it's not very user friendly either.

To remove that step and improve users experience, there are currently some \_gas less \_tools. But what does this means? Gas Less tools, are tools that can be wired to you current dapp and avoid the need of the final user to pay for a transaction.

By doing so, another account will be paying the transaction, meaning that, most likely, will be the system owner paying it.

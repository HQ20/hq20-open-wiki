We've done ir for a while. Crowdsale are basicaly used to ICO's. In case you don't know what an ICO is, here ([Explain me like I’m five: What is ICO](https://medium.com/meetngreetme-ico/explain-me-like-im-five-what-is-ico-19f967669cad)) is an explanation and here ([Launching an ICO in 2019](https://www.techhq.io/6855/launching-an-ico-in-2019/)) is a overview o what's been happening.



Below are some examples we've been colleting over time. They were mostly done during some otherhackathon project, or experiments. There is a second section when it's possible to find escrow contracts which are sometimes tied to with crowdsales.
